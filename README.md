# InsertionSort-MergeSort-QuickSort-JSON-Study
3 Programs:
- Program 1:
- 	Takes JSON file as input that represents the output of a sorting algorithm and verifies that
	each sample is a sorted array.
  If a sample array is not sorted, the algorithm finds the locations of the consecutive inversion which is when the ith element is equal to or larger than the i + 1st element.
